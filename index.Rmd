Hi everyone! My name is Matariya, but I go by Mati for short. 

I am currently a **Master of Public Health student at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University** specializing in **Epidemiology** with a certificate in *Biostatistics and Public Health Data Science*. During my free time, I love to try new restaurants around the city with my friends.
